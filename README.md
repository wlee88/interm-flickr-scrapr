# Who wants a mass amount of Doggo picks from flickr?

# instructions
## Prerequisites
- (optional) if you're a windows user, extend git bash to get wget by following the instructions (here)[https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058] don't get the zip files, just get wget64.exe and rename it wget.
- if you are using a unix based OS, grant script permissions with chmod +x download_doggos.sh

## 
- Now check the search term you need. The results returned from the script will be the same as what you search here (http://flickr.com/)[http://flickr.com/] 
-- for example "dog jumping" is great and returns over 100000 images. 
- **IMPORTANT: if you term has a space, please change this for a +.**
- run the script ./download_doggos.sh and wait a while.
- horrah - hundreds of scraped flickr pics!

# Notes

- At the moment the script downloads the flickr images directly into your directory.
